FocusTime is an Android app that helps users avoid distractions of phones by blocking a list of apps in a period of time set by the users.

A list of apps will be provided by FocusTime and users can select which app they want to block.The list of selected apps will be disabled in the period set by the users which is called Focus Mode. Once users enter the Focus Mode, they can concentrate on work and avoid distractions of phone. However, the other apps on the phone that are not in the list of selected apps and the system pre-installed apps can still function normally. So, only the distracting apps (e.g. FaceBook, YouTube) are blocked and other apps that are necessary for study (e.g. Phone, Calculator) can still be used.

Once users enter the Focus Mode, they will get punishment for quitting it--FocusTime will automatically play horrible music loudly for 3 minutes. 

With FocusMode, we hope to bring efficiency to your work and diminish distractions of your phone.
