=== Blacklisted apps
A list of apps will be provided by FocusTime and you can select a list of apps that you don't want to be distrated by. When the timer start, those apps will be disabled. So if you try to open a blacklisted app, FocusTime will close it.

[NOTE]
However, the other apps on the phone that are not in the list of selected apps and the system pre-installed apps can still function normally. +
So, only the distracting apps(e.g. FaceBook, YouTube) are blocked and other apps that are useful and not distracting(e.g. Phone, Calculator) can still be used.

=== Punishment
When the timer starts, if you want to quit it, you will get punishment which is--a one-minute-long annoying music.

Even if you want to force FocusTime to quit by removing from Recent application list by swiping, you will still get punishment the next time when you open the app.
